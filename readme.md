## No-Eye Haptic Clock
I'm a pretty light sleeper so sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. I often wonder the time, so that I can decide whether or not it's worth it to try and go back to sleep. However, every time I would try to look at my phone it would either be too bright to look at, or my eyes would be too heavy to open.

This project is a haptic clock that vibrates a sequence indicating the digits of the time. This way I can learn the time silently and without opening my eyes. 

"Wait" - you may be thinking - "you are too sleepy to open your eyes but can decode the time from a sequence of vibrations?"

A valid question indeed. Somewhat surprisingly, after only a few nights of practice, I was able to easily "read" the time even moments after waking up. I'm working hard on making sure the haptics are as high quality and as easily distinguishable as possible to make readings simple.

This repo contains code and the KiCAD project. I'm currently on board revision 3, although the code for this version is not yet ready.
