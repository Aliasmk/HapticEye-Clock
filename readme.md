## HapticEye Clock
I'm a pretty light sleeper so sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. I often wonder what the time is so that I can decide whether or not it's worth it to try and go back to sleep. However, every time I would try to look at my phone it would either be too bright to look at, or my eyes would be too heavy to open.

This project is a haptic clock that vibrates a sequence indicating the digits of the time. This way I can learn the time silently and without opening my eyes. 

"Wait" - you may be thinking - "you are too sleepy to open your eyes but can decode the time from a sequence of vibrations?"

A valid question indeed. Somewhat surprisingly, after only a few nights of practice I was able to easily "read" the time even moments after waking up. I'm working hard on making sure the haptics are of high quality and easily distinguishable to make readings simple. If the haptics prove too challenging, there's also an option to have the clock audibly speak the time.

This repo contains code and the KiCAD project.
